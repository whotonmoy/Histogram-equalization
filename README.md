# Histogram-equalization
Histogram Equalization Implementation: Enhancing Image Contrast and Visibility

It is a program that implements the traditional histogram equalization algorithm. That is compute the histogram of an input image; compute its cumulative histogram; and transform the input image using CDF as the transformation function.

The program is tested using the provided Images test1.raw and test2.raw

This was an assignment that I did in my second to last semester(Fall 2023) for Image Processing Course (CS 425).
